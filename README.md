# Entree Chicago recommendation system

### Description of the recommender system
    The system recommends restaurants to the user based on factors such as cuisine, price, style, atmosphere, etc. 
    The user can then provide feedback such as find a nicer or less expensive restaurant.

    The (tab-separated) fields are as follows: Date, IP, EntryPoint, R1, R2, ..., RN, EndPoint R1, R2, ... RN are the rates of the rated restaurants.

    It is suitable for research in Knowledge based and Case-based Recommender Systems. He has also used the dataset in 
    (R. Burke, Knowledge-based recommender systems) to build a domain-independent Casebased Recommender System for on-line information access.
